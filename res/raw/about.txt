Supports Paste encryption. If encryption is selected pastes are encrypted server side (AES-256) with a password. A SHA-256 hash of the password is stored in the database, not the passphrase itself, which helps ensure that only those who know the password will be able to view the content of your paste. All traffic is sent over SSL

Supports over 100 languages. Languages are listed in order of common (C, Java , Text Only, etc) , other (ActionScript, Debian Source File, etc ) and combo (XML+Ruby , HTML+Django/jinja, etc) .

Supports pastes of up to 200,000 characters

Pastes are not listed. Pastee assures users that it will never list or index your pastes for any reason. Privacy and security are essential to Pastee.
